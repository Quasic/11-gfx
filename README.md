# DragonBasher-gfx
Graphics packs to be used with the [Dragon Basher](https://github.com/Quasic/DragonBasher) repository

Different packs will use different branches or different repos.

Credits for images will be in the [license.txt](//github.com/Quasic/license.txt) file.

## master pack (Queville)
The master pack is based on the one from [Queville](http://queville.com).

Many of the enemy graphics come from old school public domain Nethack/Rouge "[RLTiles](http://rltiles.sourceforge.net/)".

Most of the buildings are from [Reiner's Tileset](http://www.reinerstilesets.de/). Reiner has a variety of 2d and 3d artwork available and is awesome.

Other graphics, such as the ground tiles and
characters, were drawn by Joe using
[Photofiltre](http://photofiltre.en.softonic.com/) mostly, as it has a smaller "footprint"
than programs like Gimp and has an old-school
PSP (that's Paint Shop Pro) feel to it.

[Quasic](//github.com/Quasic)'s only pre-git imagery contribution was a gray character head and body facing front, instead of left or right, for use when a character is first created. It was drawn in Photofiltre based on the left and right images. (I made two versions, one with the arms on the body instead of the head graphic, and both may be on here, somewhere...)
